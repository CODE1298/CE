Firewall is a protection layer for system it blocks unwanted and suspicious connection requests.

In this first part we will see how to restrict ssh access for particular user.

SSH-Secure Shell it will provide you shell access of the target system. It runs on port-22.
If someone forget about this port then that particular system will be compromised and eventually whole network.

Consider we have system1 and system2, now sys1 wants to work on sys2 without switching the systems then in that case system2 person
will grant access to system1 to take ssh.

System2:(172.168.1.2)

firewall-cmd --list-all
systemctl start sshd.service
systemctl restart sshd.service
systemctl enable sshd.service
systemctl status sshd.service

firewall-cmd --permanent  --add-service=ssh
firewall-cmd --reload

System1:(172.168.1.1)

ssh -X root@172.168.1.2
{after hitting enter it will ask you for password then put it accordingly}

This is how we could get access of another systems

NOW we will restrict system1

System2:

*For restricting systems
man firewalld.richlanguage
{/examples --> rich rules copy that rule}
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule  "rule family=ipv4 source address=172.168.1.1 service name="ssh" reject"
firewall-cmd --reload

NOW try to access this system from system1.
So this is how we can restrict systems for getting access.
