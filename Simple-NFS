This implementation is for redhat operating system version 7 (RHELv7)
*Network File Sharing is the utility which allows you to share file over the network(connected). This is also known as simple NFS as it does not require any authentication.
*It is not cross platform sharing tool it will require two common os based systems.

Every service implementation has some basic steps like 
1) Installation
2) Service Activation
3) Sharing/Implementation
4) Service Restart
5) Firewall Entry

This above steps are quite similer in every utility implementaion in linux

For NFS we require two systems -> sys1, sys2 (you can add two virtual machines)
sys1- IP(172.168.1.1)
sys2- IP(172.168.1.2)   this ip will vary according to your network.

system-1

yum install nfs   -> yum is the package download utility in RHEL it requires repositary path set in repo.repo file.
systemctl start nfs   -> This command starts,enable,restart and stop the mentioned service.
systemctl enable nfs    -> This allows service to be in start phase after reboot also.
mkdir /nfsshare   -> mkdir will create directory
vim /etc/export   -> vim is a latest editor you can also use vi
*content in export file*
{/nfsshare    (#destinationip)172.168.1.2(ro,sync)}
exportfs -r
firewall-cmd --permenant --add-service=nfs    -> This is must if you forgot to mention nfs in firewall then you wont be able to mount dir. on sys2
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl restart nfs
showmount -e

(Note:- If you dont know what's the full name of service or command then put first 1-2 letters of that command and then press TAB)

DONE WITH SYSTEM-1

system-2

yum install nfs
systemctl start nfs
systemctl enable nfs
mkdir /mount
vim /etc/fstab    -> Here permenant mount entries are mention. Due to this, after reboot also your directory will remain mounted.
*content*
{system1.domain:/nfsshare   /mount    nfs   defaults    0   0 }
mount -av     -> This will show is your mounting is successfull or not
df -hT    -> Shows info about where you had mounted the shared directory

DONE WITH NFS SIMPLE NFS
